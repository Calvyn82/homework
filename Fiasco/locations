The Mission - Flashback
The chart table of USS Saddleback, an unusual chart on display
The deck of Cannon-class Destroyer Escrot USS Eldridge
Hunted, depth-charged, leaking, sinking
On the surface, an island on the horizon, dinghies on deck
Hell itself, or a reasonable facsimile
The sunken wreck of a German E-Boat

--marker
Groton Naval Base - Flashback
Franklin Delano Roosevelt's motorcade
The Five Fathom Club, a Groton dive bar
A heavily guarded concrete bunker labeled ZEBRA PRIME
Research pressure chamber 1
In an alley, with an Admiral
Temporary duty barracks, heavy with dread

--marker
The Island - Flashback
Ruins of an ancient temple
Underground, with guns blazing
German facility
Strange pinnacle
Driftwood shelter awash in blood
Above a mass grave

--marker
Where we do things
The surreal, silent engine room
Crammed inside a blood-stained torpedo tube
Partially-flooded pump room
Officers' mess, now living up to its name
Radio operator's station, from which creepy noises emanate
The should-be-empty-now conning tower

--marker
Where we keep things
Torpedo room, with a primed 'fish' rolling on the deck
Under a filthy rack
Fresh water tank, where this thing should not be floating
Ship's pantry, curiously empty
Improvised sick bay in officer's country
Inside the leaking oil sump

--marker
Where we currently avoid
The now burnt-out Captain's quarters
Outside, in crushing deep water
In the black water tank
In the Number 3 forward torpedo tube, forcibly jammed shut
Ancient-looking steamer trunk with all the padlocks
Battery room crawlspace
