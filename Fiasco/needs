To get respect from...
...the Captain of the USS Saddleback
...the crew
...your dark master

To hide that...
...you didn't exactly follow orders regarding Operation ZEBRA
...there is a German agent aboard
...you just killed a fellow sailor
...drunk men sometimes don't do all the safety checks

To get away...
...to Cuxhaven, Lower Saxony, your ancestral home
...to your family farm, to marry your pregnant girlfriend
...from this steam pipe you're unfortunately handcuffed to
...from this stinking air and these stinking people
...from whatever is out there lurking in the depths
...with the ritual

To tell...
...the Captain what he did to your dad, right before you kill him
...the Navy what happened with Objective ZEBRA
...everybody about the ghosts, and what they want
...the Chosen One he must prepare
...your superior officer to fuck off
...the scientist what you added to his bag back on the island
