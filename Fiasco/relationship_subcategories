--Chain of Command
Friendly enemies
Officer and the crewman who seduced his love
Inspiring leader of men and his simpering toady
Fought side by side in the last war
Lazy fool and tough old veteran
Hard-case and the one who demoted him

--Crew
Ignorant farm boys
Gung-ho lunatics
Up for the same promotion
'You were both specially selected based on unique talents'
Odd-men-out on a tight-knit boat
Lovers

--RE:Objective ZEBRA
Secret agent and Navy intelligence operative
Occultist and Navy cameraman
'Doctor' and Navy handler
Secret agent and double agent
Cultists
Physicist and Navy liaison

--Old Bonds
Shipboard enemies, shore leave friends
Rivals in love
We killed a man and he haunts us
We saved a life and lived to regret it
Through 'coincidence' always paired
One shot the other, over something silly

--Criminal Past
Bad boys, roughnecks, and roustabouts
His criminal past would get him booted from the navy; only I know
Bully and weak sister
Leaders of rival shipboard gangs
Murderer and the guy he thought he killed
Victims of the boat's master grifter

--Family
Brothers
Competitive cousins
Father and son, depsite regulations
Blood brothers
Brothers-in-law
Mutual orphans who volunteered together
